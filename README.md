# SKYRA AI

Sovereign orchestration platform for **photorealistic AI image and video
production**. You give SKYRA a plain-language brief; the **AI Director** turns
it into a complete, validated production plan (scenes, characters, camera,
lighting, audio), and the **Production Engine** drives that plan through the
generation pipeline.

SKYRA is model-neutral by design: every generation engine sits behind a
provider interface, so quality can improve over time by swapping engines —
never by rewriting the platform.

> **What SKYRA is, honestly.** SKYRA is the *orchestration and quality layer*,
> not a from-scratch foundation model. It does not — and realistically cannot —
> out-train Midjourney/Flux or Kling/Veo at the raw model level; that takes
> industrial GPU clusters and research teams. What it *can* do is build a
> first-class product on top of best-in-class engines plus SKYRA's own
> planning, prompt design, continuity, and quality control. That is exactly how
> leading AI-media products are built.

## Status

| Layer | State |
|-------|-------|
| Monorepo + workspaces | ✅ clean, installs from a single root |
| Types & schemas (Zod) | ✅ full `ProductionPlan` contract |
| AI provider layer | ✅ generic router: `gemini` (free), `openai` — real models only |
| **AI Director → real plan** | ✅ real model returns a **validated, populated** plan (no mock) |
| Production Engine | ✅ iterates real scenes and generates their stills |
| **Image generation** | ✅ `gemini`/Imagen & `huggingface`/FLUX (free) · `pollinations` (free, no key) · `openai`/`replicate` (paid) |
| Video / voice / lip-sync | ⏳ not yet wired |

Everything is **real** — there is no mock/placeholder path. You need at least a
free Gemini key (planning), and images run best as a `gemini,pollinations`
chain: Gemini quality with a no-key Pollinations backup.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # runs the demo brief through Director + Production Engine
npm run typecheck  # strict TypeScript, no errors
```

`npm run dev` prints a complete `ProductionPlan` (4 populated scenes for the
demo brief), generates a still for each scene that needs one, and writes the
files under `storage/output/<projectId>/`.

## Generate real images — free options first

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Free (recommended to start):**
```bash
# Hugging Face + FLUX.1-schnell (free token: huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
SKYRA_IMAGE_PROVIDER=huggingface
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=hf_...

# or Google Gemini images (free key: aistudio.google.com/apikey)
# SKYRA_IMAGE_PROVIDER=gemini
# GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

**Paid (higher quality / throughput):**
```bash
# SKYRA_IMAGE_PROVIDER=openai      # OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# SKYRA_IMAGE_PROVIDER=replicate   # REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_...  (FLUX 1.1 pro)
```

Then `npm run dev` — each scene's `visualPrompt` is sent to the engine and the
resulting image is saved. No code changes; the engine is chosen by env.

## Planning with a real model (free)

```bash
# Google Gemini free tier plans the production
SKYRA_AI_PROVIDER=gemini
SKYRA_AI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

## Use a paid model for planning

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# in .env:
SKYRA_AI_PROVIDER=openai
SKYRA_AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

The Director asks the model for the plan as JSON and validates it against
`ProductionPlanSchema`. If the model's output is invalid, it raises a clear
error — there is no mock/canned fallback hiding failures.

## Architecture

```
brief (text)
   │
   ▼
AIDirector            asks a REAL model (Gemini/OpenAI) for a plan, validates
   │                  it with Zod (no mock fallback)
   ▼
ProductionPlan        typed, validated: scenes, characters, camera, audio
   │
   ▼
ProductionEngine      iterates scenes → generates each scene's image
   │
   ▼
Image engine chain    gemini → pollinations (fallback), configurable
```

## Roadmap

**Generation layer (the real gap to close)**
- [x] Image engine adapter (photoreal stills) behind an `ImageProvider`
- [ ] Video engine adapter (text/image-to-video) behind a `VideoProvider`
- [ ] Voice / TTS + accurate lip-sync for the avatar scenes
- [ ] Music & sound design
- [ ] Render/stitch scenes into 16:9 and 9:16 masters (ffmpeg)

**Platform**
- [ ] Persist projects & assets (DB + object storage)
- [ ] Async job queue for long video jobs
- [ ] HTTP API + auth around the orchestrator
- [ ] Per-scene quality control pass (upscale / face-restore)
